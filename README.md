<B>POV</B>: Your keyboard doesn't have [Media keys](https://wiki.jriver.com/index.php/Keyboard_Media_Keys)...

### Todo list 〒▽〒
- [x] Create a GUI for Media-ShortKeys.
- [ ] Can set / change custom key combinations through GUI.
- [ ] Maybe add abbreviation feature through GUI.
- [ ] Update [Releases](https://github.com/CheapNightbot/Media-ShortKeys/releases) to the latest v2.0.0

### Why you need this?
- Many keyboard comes with Media Keys, which can control any media playing on your device (like; play/pause & volume up/down) and it's Kool...
- <B>Best example</B>; you are listening to Spotify and you can't change track or simply play/pause songs without being focused to Spotify app window without Media Keys. Spotify shortcuts like 'Ctrl + Right Arrow' doesn't work if you are not focused to Spotify (or app is in system tray).
